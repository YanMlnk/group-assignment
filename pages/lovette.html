            <p>Lovette Jallow is currently one of the most vital voices against racism, discrimination and social
                injustice. She stands unquestionably with the marginalized and disenfranchised, clearly pointing out
                structural and individual injustices, along with the problems that arise when people are treated
                differently based on their background, religion, ethnicity, skin color or gender.</p>
            <p>Lovette came to Sweden as an 11-year-old, but she was born in Gambia among strong female role models who
                helped lay the foundation for her exceptional courage and willpower. Even in high school, Lovette would
                educate her classmates on racism and the equality of all people. She started her struggle from being
                bullied every day in school for the colour of her skin.</p>
            <p>Today, with her digital platforms and engaging lectures, Lovette has taken her commitment far outside the
                beauty industry. Her activism has made her a strong spokesperson in the fight against structural and
                everyday racism. She advocates justice and uses her voice to guide, enlighten, and emphasize the
                importance of treating people equally.</p>
            <p>As a lecturer, Lovette speaks on xenophobia as well as whiteness and white privileges. She describes
                commercialized ideal beauty standards and the consequences of being excluded from them. She shares her
                personal experiences of being an Afro-Swedish woman in a society where whiteness is norm, and discusses
                the underlying structures behind structural problems. She explains how to dismantle said structures by
                recognizing and confronting ones biases, and by using a more inclusive language and behaviour.</p>
            <p>With fact-based knowledge and personal experience, she provides sharp analyses in a strong and
                mind-opening voice that guides and educates with commitment and empathy, presenting constructive
                solutions to create a better future for everyone, belonging to everyone.</p>
