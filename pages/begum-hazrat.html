                <p class="details">Begum Hazrat Mahal was born on 1820 in faizabad, Awadh. She is known for the leading
                    role she had in the rebellion against the British East India Company during the Indian Rebellion of
                    1857.Hazrat Mahal was another brave woman who fought against the British during India’s First War of
                    Independence in 1857. Such bravery in those male-dominated societies was unprecedented.<br>
                    Her story is very similar to Rani Laxmi Bai.

                    Hazrat Mahal started life as a courtesan but became a begum of the last Nawab of Awadh, Wajid Ali
                    Shah. After her husband was exiled, she took charge of the state of Awadh and seized control of
                    Lucknow.<br>
                    Begum Hazrat organised an army of women and actively took part in the revolt of 1857 against the
                    “Doctrine of Lapse” under which Dalhousie wanted her to surrender Lucknow.

                    Hazrat Mahal put up a stiff resistance but she was eventually defeated and the British recaptured
                    Lucknow. She escaped to Nepal and died there.
