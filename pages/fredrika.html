            <p>Fredrika Bremer (17 August 1801 – 31 December 1865) was a Finnish-born Swedish writer and feminist
                reformer. Her Sketches of Everyday Life were wildly popular in Britain and the United States during the
                1840s and 1850s and she is regarded as the Swedish Jane Austen, bringing the realist novel to prominence
                in Swedish literature.</p>
            <p>Fredrika and her sisters were raised to marry and became socialites and hostesses within the upper class
                like their own French-trained mother. They were given the education then conventional for girls of their
                class in Sweden, with private tutors followed by a family trip through Germany, Switzerland, France, and
                the Netherlands in 1821 and 1822 before their social debuts.</p>
            <p>Upon her return to Sweden, she debuted into upper-class society in Stockholm and Årsta but found the
                enforced passivity of women's life intolerable: "How quietly, like muddy water, time stands for a youth,
                who, during a boring and idle life, drags out her days.</p>
            <p>Following her return to Sweden in November, Bremer attempted to engage its middle- and upper-class ladies
                in social work similar to what she had found in America and England. She co-founded the Stockholm
                Women's Society for Children's Care (Skyddsmödraförening or Stockholms Fruntimmersförening för
                Barnavård) to assist the orphans left by the 1853 Stockholm cholera outbreak</p>
