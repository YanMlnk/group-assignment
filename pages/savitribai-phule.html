                <p class="details">Savitribai Phule was born on 3 January 1831 Naigaon, Bombay Presidency, British
                    India(present-day Maharashtra, India). She was a Dalit woman and a pioneer of feminism in India. She
                    was also the country’s first female teacher who went on to set up 17 more schools that imparted
                    education to women of all castes.<br>
                    She worked alongside her husband and other women, to abolish caste and gender discrimination. She
                    also set up the 'Balhatya Pratibandhak Griha' to prevent female infanticide, and campaigned against
                    the killing of widows and pregnant rape victims. Savitribai Phule is highly revered by advocates of
                    the feminist movement in India today.<br>
                    Savitribai Phule was also an author and poet. She published Kavya Phule in 1854 and Bavan Kashi
                    Subodh Ratnakar in 1892, and also a poem entitled "Go, Get Education" in which she encouraged those
                    who are oppressed to free themselves by obtaining an education. As a result of her experience and
                    work, she became an ardent feminist. She established the Mahila Seva Mandal to raise awareness for
                    issues concerning women's rights.</p>
