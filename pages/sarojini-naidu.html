                <p class="details">Sarojini Naidu was born 13 February 1879 in Hyderabad, Hyderabad State, British India. Sarojini Naidu was the second Indian woman to be president of the Indian National Congress and the first one to be appointed the governor of an Indian state.<br>

                    She founded the Women’s India Association in 1917 and was also one of the few women to take part in the Satyagraha movement. She participated in the Round table conference with Mahatma Gandhi and Madan Mohan Malaviya.
                    
                    Sarojini Naidu is the other very well known name in this list. She is the most famous woman in the list of freedom fighters who took the non-violence route against the British.<br>
                    Naidu began writing at the age of 12. Her play, Maher Muneer, written in Persian, impressed the Nizam of Kingdom of Hyderabad.

                    Naidu's poetry is written in english , and usually took the form of lyric poetry in the tradition of British Romanticism, which she was sometimes challenged to reconcile with her Indian nationalist politics.She was known for her vivid use of rich sensory images in her writing, and for her lush depictions of India. She was well-regarded as a poet, considered the "Indian Yeats".
