            <p>Elise Ottesen-Jensen, one of the major personalities in European family planning and sex education, was
                born in 1886 as the 17th of 18 children, only 11 of whom survived infancy. Norwegian-born feminist and
                author who was the leading advocate of sex education and sex law reform in Sweden (1920sâ€“1950s) and a
                leader in the international family planning movement.</p>
            <p>Ottesen-Jensen had wanted to become a physician, but family finances made this impossible, so she settled
                on becoming a dentist. While studying, however, she lost three fingers in a laboratory explosion,
                forever ruling out dentistry as a career. After working for a short time as a stenographer at the
                national Parliament, she decided to take up journalism.</p>
            <p>Women, particularly if they were poor, lived in terror of unwanted pregnancies, and a 1910 Swedish law
                decreed severe penalties for those who had an abortion. During this period, Ottesen-Jensen quickly
                became a respected journalist. Using the pen name "Ottar," she covered the 1912 Olympic summer games,
                which took place in Stockholm. Her articles on the need for reform of Sweden's abortion laws, as well as
                her spirited advocacy of women's rights, including suffrage, made her well known in working-class
                circles.</p>
            <p>In 1913, she met Albert Jensen. A well-known Swedish syndicalist, Jensen espoused views that were
                progressive and often radical. Through him, Elise met and was influenced by Hinke Bergegren, a male
                radical who was unusually sensitive to the women's agenda of the day. Ottesen-Jensen was particularly
                struck by Bergegren's slogan "Love Without Babies," which advocated smaller families for workers, as
                opposed to the often grim reality of babies without love.</p>
